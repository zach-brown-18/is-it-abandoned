    "**Problem Statement:** Abandoned and vacant buildings are traditionally identified through a tedious and inefficient process of manual, on-the-ground identification. Modern approaches evaluate a building's likelihood of occupancy through utility data -- whether the building has running water; whether it has an active account with a gas utility; etc. These modern approaches use machine learning by training a predictive model on existing utility and building vacancy data. To date, I have found no attempt to identify vacant and abandoned buildings through a visual machine learning approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will attempt to train a binary classification model that intakes satellite imagery of Indianapolis, IN and classifies a building as either occupied or vacant. This is a preliminary step to see if this approach yields promising results for further development. Given my limited time, limited access to data, and limited expertise in this field, I set my threshold for a potentially useful approach at a model accuracy of +10% above the baseline model, and a sensitivity of +10% above the baseline model. If these goals are satisfied, I recommend training a more general model on cities accross the United States that will achieve this goal for any urban area in the country."
